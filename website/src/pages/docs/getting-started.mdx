# Getting Started

Welcome to LinguAI! This guide will help you get up and running with acoustic analysis in just a few minutes.

## System Requirements

LinguAI runs on:
- **macOS** 11 (Big Sur) or later
- **Windows** 10 or later
- **Linux** Ubuntu 20.04+ or equivalent

Minimum specs:
- 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 500MB disk space
- Audio input device for recording (optional)

## Installation

### Desktop App (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release from our [releases page](https://github.com/adtruiz/linguai/releases)
2. Run the installer for your platform
3. Launch LinguAI from your applications folder

### Web Version

No installation required! Visit [app.linguai.app](https://app.linguai.app) to use LinguAI directly in your browser.

> **Note:** The web version requires a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) and an internet connection. Some features like local file access are limited compared to the desktop app.

## Creating Your First Project

1. **Launch LinguAI** and click "New Project"
2. **Import audio** by dragging a `.wav` or `.mp3` file into the window
3. **View the spectrogram** - it generates automatically
4. **Add annotations** by clicking on the waveform or using AI auto-detect

## Importing from Praat

Already have Praat files? LinguAI can import them:

1. Go to **File > Import > Praat Files**
2. Select your `.TextGrid` file
3. If prompted, select the corresponding audio file
4. Your annotations will be preserved exactly

You can also export back to TextGrid format at any time.
