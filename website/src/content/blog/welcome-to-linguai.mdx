We're excited to introduce LinguAI—a modern, AI-native platform for acoustic analysis designed specifically for phoneticians, linguists, and researchers.

## Why We Built LinguAI

Praat has been the gold standard for acoustic analysis since 1991. It's powerful, reliable, and free. We learned phonetics with Praat. We still use Praat.

But after three decades, the field has changed:

- **AI can now detect phonemes automatically** with surprising accuracy
- **Collaboration is expected**—Zoom calls and Google Docs are the norm
- **Modern interfaces** have raised the bar for usability
- **Privacy concerns** make cloud-only solutions problematic

We built LinguAI to bring acoustic analysis into the 2020s while preserving what makes Praat great.

## What Makes LinguAI Different

### Same Algorithms, New Interface

LinguAI is built on [Parselmouth](https://parselmouth.readthedocs.io/), a Python wrapper for Praat. This means you get the same proven algorithms—formant tracking, pitch analysis, spectrogram generation—in a modern, intuitive interface.

No more hunting through nested menus. No more scripting just to export data.

### AI-Powered Annotations

Our Pro tier includes AI auto-annotation:

- **Phoneme detection** trained on thousands of hours of speech
- **Word alignment** that actually works
- **Speaker diarization** for multi-speaker recordings

The AI does the first pass. You refine. What used to take hours now takes minutes.

### Local-First, Privacy-Focused

Your audio stays on your machine by default. No uploading to mysterious servers. No wondering who's listening to your participants' data.

Cloud sync is available for Pro users who want it—fully encrypted, with data residency options for GDPR compliance.

### Real-Time Collaboration

Share a project with your lab. Work on annotations together. See changes in real-time. Leave comments for your colleagues.

No more emailing TextGrid files back and forth.

## Open Source Core

LinguAI's core analysis engine is open source under GPL-3.0. You can:

- Inspect the code
- Modify it for your needs
- Contribute improvements
- Use it for free, forever

We believe in open science. The analysis tools should be open too.

## What's Next

We're currently in beta. Here's what we're working on:

- **More AI models** for different languages and varieties
- **Praat script import** to preserve your existing workflows
- **Mobile app** for field recordings
- **API access** for programmatic analysis

## Join the Beta

We're looking for researchers to try LinguAI and help us make it better. Beta testers get:

- Free access to all Pro features
- Direct line to the development team
- 50% off Pro when we launch

Ready to try the future of acoustic analysis?
