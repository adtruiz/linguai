We get this question a lot: "Should I switch from Praat to LinguAI?"

The honest answer: it depends. Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide.

## The Quick Summary

| Factor | Praat | LinguAI |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Price** | Free | Free core / $19/mo Pro |
| **Learning curve** | Steep | Gentle |
| **Scripting** | Praat scripting | Python (planned) |
| **UI** | 1990s | Modern |
| **AI features** | None | Pro tier |
| **Collaboration** | File sharing | Real-time sync |
| **Stability** | Rock solid | Beta |

## When to Use Praat

**You should stick with Praat if:**

- You have complex Praat scripts that would be painful to rewrite
- You need features LinguAI doesn't have yet (like synthesis)
- You prefer command-line or scripting-first workflows
- You're working on a project that requires citing specific software versions
- Budget is a hard constraint and you need AI features

Praat isn't going anywhere. It's been reliable for 30+ years and will continue to be.

## When to Use LinguAI

**LinguAI might be better if:**

- You're new to acoustic analysis and want an easier start
- You spend hours manually annotating and want AI assistance
- You work with a team and need real-time collaboration
- You value a modern, intuitive interface
- You handle sensitive audio and need privacy guarantees

## The Best of Both Worlds

Here's a secret: you don't have to choose.

LinguAI fully supports TextGrid import and export. Our recommended workflow:

1. **Use LinguAI** for initial analysis and AI-assisted annotation
2. **Export to TextGrid** when you need Praat-specific features
3. **Import back** when you want to collaborate or use AI

Your existing Praat workflows aren't wasted—they're enhanced.

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### Spectrogram Analysis

Both tools use the same underlying algorithms. LinguAI's display is higher resolution and more responsive, but the acoustic data is identical.

**Winner:** Tie (same algorithms)

### Formant Tracking

Same algorithms, different interfaces. LinguAI makes it easier to adjust settings visually. Praat gives you more scripting control.

**Winner:** Depends on workflow

### Annotation

LinguAI's annotation interface is faster for manual work. The AI auto-annotation feature (Pro) can save hours on large datasets.

**Winner:** LinguAI

### Scripting

Praat has a mature scripting language with 30 years of community scripts. LinguAI doesn't have scripting yet (Python support planned).

**Winner:** Praat

### Synthesis

Praat has built-in synthesis. LinguAI is analysis-only.

**Winner:** Praat

### Collaboration

LinguAI has real-time collaboration. Praat requires manually sharing files.

**Winner:** LinguAI

### Learning Curve

LinguAI's interface is designed to be intuitive. Praat requires significant time investment.

**Winner:** LinguAI

## A Note on Stability

We need to be honest: Praat is battle-tested software used by thousands of researchers over decades. LinguAI is in beta.

If you're working on a critical project with a deadline, Praat is the safer choice. If you're exploring or have flexibility, try LinguAI and help us improve.

## Our Recommendation

- **Students learning phonetics:** Start with LinguAI, learn Praat later
- **Active researchers:** Try LinguAI for new projects, keep Praat for existing ones
- **Research labs:** Pilot LinguAI with one project, scale if it works

## Try It Yourself

The best way to decide is to try both. LinguAI's free tier includes all analysis features—no credit card required.
